// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

// Here is the order: 
// 1. Planning 
// 2. Analysis of Requirements 
// 3. Design 
// 4. Implementation 
// 5. Testing & Integration
// 6. Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which the main components of the software/application are defined to accomplish its purpose.(i.e. what are the must needs of the project to function as expected)"

const design = "This is the third step, in which the the front and back end configurations are planned. This includes how the application interface will look, its ease of usability, and the overall flow of the application/software. "
 
const implementation = "This is the fourth step, in which steps 1-3 are carried out and development begins."
 
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, in which developers run checks for bugs or any other problems that may have arose during implementation. Unit testing is a common tool here to account for edge cases or other situations that may happen if the user uses the software incorrectly."

const maintain = "This is the sixth step, in which developers maintain and update the code for the project. This part of the life cycle includes releasing new/better versions of the software as time goes on and users provide feedback."
